# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

To setup the project, perform the following:
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAmRiteshKoushik/chronos
```
2. Get into the application directory
```bash
cd chronos-app
```
3. Run `pnpm` to install packages. We are using pnpm instead of yarn or npm due 
to its fast load times. In-case you do not have it installed, consider installing
and using it. The speed difference is visible.
```bash
pnpm install
```
